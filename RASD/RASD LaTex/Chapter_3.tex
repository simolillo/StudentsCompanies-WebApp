\chapter{Specific Requirements}

\section{External Interface Requirements}
\subsection{User Interface}
This section presents mockups of the most relevant graphical user interfaces (GUIs) used by the 
Student\&Companies platform to interact with external users, such as companies' employees and students. 
The purpose of these representations is to outline the 
logical characteristics of the interfaces and provide guidelines on the style and appearance of the final product. 

\paragraph{Log In Interface}
Log In Interface for both Companies and Students, 
username, email and password are required. 
Once every field is filled correctly the user can access 
pressing the Log In button.

\paragraph{Available Intership List}
This inteface displays the available internships, the
view is optimized based on the Recommendation Engine.
\begin{figure} [H]

    \includegraphics [width=.7\linewidth] {internshipBrowsing.png}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Student and Company Profile View}
Both Students and Companies pages have a profile picture of their choice,
an email and a phone number as contact information,
however they differ slightly, 
as the Student has the university in which he/she belongs
displayed at the bottom, while the Company has the the name
of the current CEO.
Furthermore, on the left, the Student page allows anyone
to download the Student's CV, whereas the Company's page
displays its available internships.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Internship Creation Form and Preliminary Internship Questionnaire}
Both interfaces are forms with different purposes, the first is
exclusively for Companies, mandatory in order to create a new intership
position which will be available for Students' application.
The second is exclusively for Students, this form will appear after 
a Student click apply on an available internship.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Hardware Interface}
The S\&C platform requires a server to host all its 
functionalities, in order to offer the best service possible
the server machine requires some key hardware components with 
their corresponding interfaces:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A processor (CPU) capable of handling concurrent user requests and process data.
    \item Main memory (RAM).
    \item Data Storage (Hard Disk/SSD).
    \item  Network Interface Card (NIC): A reliable network interface for communication
    between the server and usersâ€™ devices.
\end{itemize}

S\&C will be an online web platform so the following hardware 
components are also mandatory:

\begin {itemize}
    \item High speed and reliable Internt Connection in order to maintain a running platform and guarantee efficiency
    \item Firewall and Security Protocols for the safety of users data
    \item Load Balancers
\end {itemize}

The end-users' minimus requirements (hardware wise) are:

\begin {itemize}
    \item Computer or Mobile devices
    \item Reliable Internet connection
    \item Network Interface Card
\end {itemize}

\subsection{Software Interface}
\begin {itemize}
    \item Client-server interactions occur by the means of a HTTPS protocol to exchange data and information
    \item Database Interface as a database is needed to store and manipulate users' data
\end {itemize}

\section{Functional Requirements}
\subsection{Use Case Diagram}
\begin{figure} [H]

    \includegraphics [width=.8\linewidth] {usecasewhite.png}
    \caption{S\&C Use Case Diagram}
\end{figure}
A UML Use Case Diagram visually represents the interactions between users (actors) and the system. 
It focuses on identifying the system's functionalities (use cases) and how various actors engage with them.
These diagrams are essential for understanding system requirements, defining its scope, and providing a high-level overview of user-system interactions, 
making them particularly useful in requirement analysis.
The diagram identifies key actors such as Students, Companies, Universities, and the Statistical Analysis Tool (internal to the platform) 
and captures their interactions with the system's core processes. Key use cases include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Searching and Applying for Internships:
Students can proactively search through available internships and apply to those matching their skills and interests.

\item Publishing Internship Offers:
Companies can advertise internships, providing detailed descriptions, requirements, and terms.

\item Recommendation Mechanism:
The system matches students with suitable internships based on keyword searches, statistical analysis, and feedback data.

\item Selection and Interview Management:
Companies use the platform to manage interviews and assess candidates through questionnaires.

\item Feedback and Complaints:
Both students and companies provide feedback, which is used to improve the recommendation process and refine submissions (e.g., CVs or project descriptions).

\item Monitoring and Issue Handling
Universities, monitor internships, address complaints, and ensure proper resolution of disputes.
\end {itemize}

\subsection{Use Cases}
This section outlines the primary interactions between users and the system, 
detailing the various scenarios in which the system is utilized to achieve specific goals. 
Each use case describes the roles of actors, the sequence of actions, and the expected outcomes, 
providing a clear understanding of how the system fulfills its functional requirements.

\subsection{Activity Diagrams}
Activity diagrams are created to give insights about specific sequences of operations
occurring in some parts of the system being described.
Recommendation Engine process and Internship Selection Process are being represented:
\begin{figure} [H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics [width=.7\linewidth] {actdiagram.png}
\end{figure}

The Recommendation Engine diagram illustrates 
the process through which the platform matches students with 
internships based on the evaluation of their CVs and the internship details. 
It starts when a student submits their CV and a company posts an internship. 
The system analyzes both using keyword matching and statistical analysis to generate a recommendation score.
 The score is then evaluated against a predefined threshold. 
 If the score is above the threshold, the student and company are notified of a suitable match.

The Internship Selection Process diagram 
captures the steps taken once a student 
has been matched with an internship. 
After a recommendation is accepted, 
the company schedules and conducts 
an interview with the student. 
The candidate is evaluated 
based on the interview outcome. 
If the candidate is deemed a good fit, 
both the student and the company are notified, 
and the selection is finalized.
