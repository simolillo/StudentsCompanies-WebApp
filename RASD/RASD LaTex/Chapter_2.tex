\subsection{Domain Class Diagram}
The class diagram provided below offers a high-level overview of the domains of interest
for the software implementation.
The diagram can be divided into three main sections:

The central section contains the main entities related to users: Student, Company and University. 
This section contains also the related classes StudentProfile and Internship.

The lower section illustrates the primary interactions between students and companies necessary
for successfully performing an internship: PreliminaryMatch, SelectionProcess, FinalMatch,
and Internship. This area also includes important management classes such as SelectionProcessManager
and InternshipManager.

The upper section displays the main classes related to the recommendation system: RecommendationEngine,
NotificationSystem and PreliminaryData,
while on the right side it displays the classes for Feedback, Suggestion and Complaint.

    \caption{Class Diagram}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsection{State Charts}
In this section, we analyze the state charts related to the selection process and the management
of complaints by universities. We believe these two scenarios are the most significant to represent
with this type of diagram due to their structured sequences of well-defined events.

\subsubsection{Selection Process}


\begin{figure} [H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics [width=.4\linewidth] {sc_SelectionProcess.png}
    \caption{State Charts 1 - Selection Process}
\end{figure}

The diagram illustrates the phases of the selection process. The initial stage begins
with the student being matched to an internship opportunity,
represented as the "PreliminaryMatch" state. Once the match occurs, the
system establishes contact between the company and the student,
transitioning the process to the "contact established" state.

At this point, an interview is scheduled. If the student does not participate in the
interview, the process halts. However,
if the student participates, the interview is conducted, leading to the evaluation phase.

During the evaluation, the company assesses the student’s performance and suitability.
If the evaluation is positive, the company makes an offer, indicated as the "offer made" state.
If the evaluation is negative, the process terminates without any further steps.

Following the offer, the next stage depends on the student’s response. If the student
declines the offer, the process concludes without an agreement. On the other hand,
if the student accepts, the process progresses to the "FinalMatch" state. At this point,
the internship officially begins, marking the finalization of the selection process.

\subsubsection{Complaints management}


\begin{figure} [H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics [width=.4\linewidth] {sc_UniComplaint.png}
    \caption{State Charts 2 - Complaints management}
\end{figure}

The diagram illustrates the complaint management process within the context of an internship.
The flow begins when a complaint is received, prompting an investigation to examine the issue.
Once the investigation is completed, a solution is proposed to address the complaint.

If the proposed solution is accepted, the complaint is closed, and the internship can
continue as usual. However, if the solution is not accepted, the internship is terminated,
bringing the process to an end.

This diagram clearly highlights the two possible outcomes of the complaint resolution process:
a positive resolution, which results in the complaint being closed, or a negative outcome,
which leads to the termination of the internship.
