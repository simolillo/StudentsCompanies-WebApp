\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}


The \textit{Students\&Companies (S\&C)} platform bridges the gap between university students seeking
internships and companies offering them. It simplifies the process of matching students with internship
opportunities based on their skills, experiences, and preferences, as well as companies' requirements
and offered benefits.

The software involves three main actors: \textbf{students}, \textbf{companies}, and \textbf{universities}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Students} use the platform to search and apply for internships, submit their CVs, and
    receive recommendations tailored to their profiles.
    \item \textbf{Companies} advertise internships, specify requirements, and manage the selection
    process for suitable candidates.
    \item \textbf{Universities} monitor the execution of internships and handle complaints or
    issues that may arise.
\end{itemize}

S\&C features a \textbf{recommendation system} that matches students and internships using mechanisms
ranging from keyword-based searches to advanced statistical analyses. The platform also facilitates
communication, supports the selection process, and tracks internship progress to ensure transparency
for all involved parties.
