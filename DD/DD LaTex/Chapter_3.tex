\chapter{User Interface Design}
This chapter displays a more in depth analysis of the "3.1.1" section called "User Interface" of the
 Requirements Analysis and
 Specification Document (RASD) related to the S\&C project. 
 Within the scope of detail permitted in a design document, 
 it is possible to explore the various interactions the platform provides to external users,
  whether they are students or companies' authorized employees.
 The screenshots displayed in this section serve as mockups of the user interfaces provided by the system, 
 therefore they have to be interpreted as general guidelines for the designers and developers to
 grasp the application overall look at the end of the implementation process.
