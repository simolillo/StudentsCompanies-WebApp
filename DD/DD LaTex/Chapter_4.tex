\chapter{Requirements Traceability}

The traceability matrix provided below aims to establish a clear connection between the requirements outlined in the Requirements Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) and the components of the Student\&Companies system responsible for addressing them. 

The referenced components are discussed in greater detail in Section 2.2, Component View, of this Design Document, where their roles and responsibilities within the system are thoroughly explained.
